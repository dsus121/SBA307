What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?

    Spent less time looking for cool things and just concentrated on the basics.

Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?

    The CSS animations, but only because they didn't really fit with my chosen content. We should practice those more, though, as well.

What would you add to or change about your website if given more time?

    I will be adding and changing things, since this is the prototype for my actual band's actual website.

Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again.
